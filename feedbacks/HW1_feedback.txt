HW1 Feedback


Test Suite: 215/215


Valgrind: 5/5


Modularity: 4/5
(-1) HT helper function factors out some code, but could factor more things out.


Blending with starter code: 5/5


Robustness and error checking: 4/5
(-1) Calling "free" instead of the appropriate function. E.g. free(iter) instead of LLIteratorFree(iter).


Comments and other style issues: 4/5
(-1) Needs better function comment on helper function. Does not describe return codes so caller has no idea what to do with the returned value.


Bonus: /5
